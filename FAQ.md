## What kinds of sounds do killer whales make?

Killer whales produce a wide variety of underwater sounds. They use calls and whistles for social communication and echolocation clicks for orientation and discrimination of objects in their surroundings. The most characteristic sounds of killer whales are loud, strident calls about 1–2 seconds long. These calls – sometimes described as ‘metallic-sounding screams’ –  are made up of bursts of pulses emitted so rapidly that they have a tonal quality. An analogy is the sound made by rusty hinges on a gate –the gate is opened slowly, it creaks, but if opened quickly, the creak turns into a squeal. Calls can be audible underwater at ranges of over 15 km in quiet conditions.

## How many calls are there in a pod’s repertoire?

Killer whales have repertoires of several to ten or more different stereotyped calls that they use to maintain contact with other group members. These call types are often very repetitive with some calls dominating vocal exchanges and others heard less frequently. Young calves probably learn these call types from their mothers and other close relatives in their group. Call repertoires are thus passed across generations by cultural transmission. Call repertoires are very stable over time – most calls in the catalogue have been used by these whales for at least 50-60 years and likely far longer.

There is much variation in the call type repertoires of different killer whale populations and, in some cases, family groups or pods. In coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific, the three ecotypes—Residents, Bigg’s (or Transients), and Offshores—have repertoires of call types that are entirely distinct from each other. There are differences in call repertoires of groups within each ecotype as well – these are best described as dialects.

## Do different call types have different meanings?

Each member of a social group (pod or matriline) produces all the call types heard from the group as a whole. Although some calls are used more often than others in certain contexts, such as during group resting or during high-speed travel, no call type appears to be linked strongly to any particular behaviour. Some call types tend to occur together, but so far there is no evidence of a syntax such as in human language. The call repertoire of a pod or matriline is learned by young whales as they grow up, and appears to function like an acoustic ‘family badge’ that maintains the cohesion and integrity of the group.

## How are call types and subtypes named?

Call types in the catalogue are named with an alphanumeric ID – the letter refers to the killer whale population that produces the call (S for Southern Resident, N for Northern Resident, and T for Bigg’s killer whales). Call numbers were assigned arbitrarily in the order that calls were identified when the catalogue was first created in the 1980s. In cases where there are gaps in the sequence of call numbers, this is a result of revisions to the catalogue as it was developed. During the process of call identification and naming, some provisional call types were assigned an alphanumeric ID that was later judged to be a variant of another, more common call type and so was subsumed into the latter category and the provisional alphanumeric name was ’retired’.

## How were spectrogram parameters chosen?

Killer whale calls have most energy below 10 kHz in frequency, although some harmonics or sidebands may extend to 20 kHz or more. Most calls are between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds in duration. The frequency (vertical) and time axes of spectrograms were chosen to best visually represent the pitch and time contours of the call type.

## Why are there variable numbers of examples for different call types in the catalogue?

Several examples of most call types are included to illustrate the range of variability in the calls’ structure. Only two or three examples may be provided for simple calls, while more complex and variable calls may have a half dozen or more examples.

## Are other killer whale populations to be included in the catalogue?

This initial release of the catalogue currently includes call types produced by the Southern Resident population of killer whales. Call of Northern Resident and Bigg’s killer whales will be added in the near future. A catalogue of calls produced by Offshore killer whales is in development.

## What can we learn from killer whale sounds?

The call dialect of a killer whale kin group is learned by calves as they grow up and are retained for life. Thus, dialects are passed on from generation to generation and are a cultural reflection of the lineage of a particular pod, clan, or population, which may persist for centuries. Patterns of similarities and differences in the dialects of resident pods have revealed much about their ancestry, with some pods being very closely related and others more distant.

The dialects of orcas are also a useful and important tool for studying the seasonal movement patterns of different pods and populations. Remote underwater acoustical devices placed on the seafloor or hydrophones cabled to shore collect recordings of killer whale sounds, which can then be interpreted to identify the population and, for Resident orcas, the clan or pod(s) present. Passive acoustic monitoring is effective throughout the year, day and night, and during stormy weather.

For those wishing to take a deeper dive into killer whale dialects and how they are used to monitor the seasonal movements of the whales, the following are some relevant scientific publications:
