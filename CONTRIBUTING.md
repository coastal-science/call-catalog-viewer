# Introduction

### Thanks for taking the time to contribute to the call catalog viewer.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

As for everything else in the project, the contributions to Hoodie are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). Everyone interacting in this project and issue tracker is expected to follow the Code of Conduct.

## How can I contribute?

The call catalog viewer is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests.

We look forward to opening this project to community development once the project has matured. At this moment, we are not looking for help writing code which can be incorporated into the viewer itself. At the moment, your ideas for improvement are welcomed.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for discussions about the catalog entries, those are maintained in the repository containing the data.

Mention other people if you want to use their expertise, have them provide an estimate, or just be aware of an issue. GitHub lets you mention users and entire teams with the @username syntax, much like Twitter and Facebook do. When you add mentions, consider the following:

- Since every mention results in an email notification to the person you’re mentioning, try to mention sparingly.
- When mentioning a user who was previously not involved in an issue, try to make it clear if there’s an action you want them to take or if you’re just making them aware of what’s going on.

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@XXXX In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@XXXX.

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue](https://github.com/coastal-science/call-catalog-viewer/issues) already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form to submit a bug report, make a feature request or bring something to the attention of the developers.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer the questions in the templates.
